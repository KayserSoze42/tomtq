# TOMTQuery

_Find movies and TV shows with methods of last resort (stuff like character names, lines spoken, locations shown, etc.)_
_by using custom TOMT (Tip Of My Tongue) Queries_

---------------------------

_**Overview:**_

_A mini "framework" to do batch queries for movies and TV shows on several popular online aggregate platforms_

_It started out as a tool to scrape IMDb but after using it few times to find movies I couldn't remember,_
_I thought it would be nice to expand it, so it could also recommend similar movies, create custom watchlists, etc.._

_Obligatory WIP_

_**Update:**_

_The idea evolved, so obviously I deleted everything and started again._
_This time starting with the query logic and then moving on to the TOMTQ parsing._


_I thought it would be fun to write a Spring REST Controller that would act as a "wrapper" for the TMDb API,_
_and deploy it perhaps in a separate container._


_No idea why would that help. Again, just having fun..._

_There are some test models and controllers, to help me visualise JSON data._
_Will play around with custom search logic._
