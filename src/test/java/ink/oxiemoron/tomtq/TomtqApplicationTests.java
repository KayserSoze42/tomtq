	// Good place as any..

	// So parsing may turn profitable here after all

	// The Idea idea = new new new new new new Idea(); is as follows;

	// Create a basic API structure for red carpet searches
	// Create a basic parser to parse .tomtq files/reddit's tomt posts (grep knows, considering..)
	// Return something at least, and at worst (hopefully) some random movie/show to watch

	// Not sure where to get stuff like lines and places [etc] easily, still investigating
	// But
	// Considering many characters are Jack and Jills, and they all live happily in Paris, Texas
	// We might be able to get away with something like:

	// Create a bunch of identifiers for common places
	// Scrape a lot of movies/shows and do some magik multiplexing (dear grep) to store as much info as possible

	// eg

	// Paris, Texas - 1
	// Paris, France - 2

	// And then we give movie/show a "12" ? movie/show has both locations else "1"/"2"

	// Other than that, we can do it at the expense of the User, and scrape at Run Time **

	// Or who knows

	// Stuck on the prev level, walking through and reading tutorials
	// Brb
